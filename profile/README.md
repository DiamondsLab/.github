# DiamondsLab

Welcome to DiamondsLab ‚Äì a collection of tools and libraries designed to streamline the development, deployment, and management of smart contract systems using the **ERC2535 Diamonds Proxy Standard**.

## About

The ERC2535 Diamonds standard enables modular smart contract systems with upgradeable functionality, unlimited contract size, and efficient organization of code. DiamondsLab provides a comprehensive toolkit to make working with Diamonds simple, efficient, and developer-friendly.

## Our Tools

### üî∑ [Diamonds](https://github.com/DiamondsLab/diamonds)
The core Node.js module for diamonds deployment and management. This is the foundation of the DiamondsLab ecosystem, providing essential functionality for working with diamond contracts.

### ‚öíÔ∏è [Hardhat-Diamonds](https://github.com/DiamondsLab/hardhat-diamonds)
Hardhat-specific tooling and tasks for the diamonds system. Integrates seamlessly with the Diamonds Node Module to provide a smooth development experience within the Hardhat framework.

### üì¶ [Diamonds-Base](https://github.com/DiamondsLab/diamonds-base)
A base template for new projects to build from. Get started quickly with a pre-configured project structure that follows best practices for diamond contract development.

### üß™ [Diamonds Development Environment](https://github.com/DiamondsLab/diamonds-dev-env)
The Diamonds Monorepo for developing and testing the integrations of the other DiamondsLab projects. This is where all the pieces come together for comprehensive testing and development.

### üê≥ [Diamonds-Devcontainer](https://github.com/DiamondsLab/diamonds-devcontainer)
A pre-configured development container for working with Diamonds projects. Provides a consistent development environment with all necessary tools and dependencies included.

### üìä [Diamonds-Monitor](https://github.com/DiamondsLab/diamonds-monitor)
A monitoring tool for diamond contracts. Track and observe the state and behavior of deployed diamond systems in real-time.

### üåê [Hardhat-Multichain](https://github.com/DiamondsLab/hardhat-multichain)
Used for localized testing of multiple Hardhat network forks simultaneously. Essential for testing cross-chain interactions and multi-network deployment scenarios.

### üöÄ [Hardhat-Multichain-Boilerplate](https://github.com/DiamondsLab/hardhat-multichain-boilerplate)
A boilerplate project for multichain development using Hardhat. Provides a starting point for building and testing contracts across multiple blockchain networks.
